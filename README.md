Hello! I'm Dmytro, a full-stack web developer with a fondness for bringing to life secure, performant, beautiful, and user-centered web applications. 

I work with a variety of programming languages (Javascript, PHP, Python, Golang), but TypeScript is where I feel confident.
On the frontend, I primarily use React and Nextjs for my projects. I also have some essential experience building sites with jQuery and HTMX.
As for the backend, my toolkit includes NodeJS and Express. I enjoy organizing data with PostgreSQL and Redis and using tools like Prisma ORM to keep everything running smoothly.

I've got a solid grip on the essentials of Computer Science, from algorithms to design patterns, and I'm agile in both my workflow and project management, thanks to Scrum and Kanban.
I'm all about making things work well and look good, so I spend time with documentation tools like JSDoc, and I keep my code sturdy with type safety at runtime using Zod.
Testing is another important part of my process, and I'm adept with tools like Jest, Playwright, and Puppeteer, not to mention Postman for testing APIs.
