When it comes to coding, my approach is all about simplicity and performance. Drawing inspiration from Scrum, Agile, and Kanban methodologies, I prioritize tasks and duties based on their priority and severity, ensuring that I optimize my time for the most impactful outcomes. You won't find me getting lost in the rabbit hole of font choices ‚Äì I believe in keeping things practical and focused on delivering practical solutions.
