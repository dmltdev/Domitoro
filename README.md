Hey there! That's me, Dmytro. I'm a team lead at Ontech.

My experience in the industry has led me to work across various programming languages, but I really like TypeScript. 
I use React and Next.js on the front end to make user interfaces that are easy to understand.
I know how to use NodeJS and Express to build services and PostgreSQL and Redis to manage data on the back end. 
I believe in following the rules of computer science, using agile project management methods, and testing web apps to make sure they work well and are reliable.
