# My developer's philosophy as an aspiring junior

## Simplicity

* Keep it small and simple: Simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
* Simplicity is hard to build, easy to use, and hard to change for.
* Complexity is easy to build, hard to use, and easy to change for.

## Modularity

* Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
* Economy and elegance of design due to size constrains: salvation through suffering.

## Elegancy

* Write programs to work together.

## Economy

* Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you will need them.

## Code Readability

* Strive for code that is easy to read and understand.
* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Follow a consistent coding style (e.g., indentation, naming conventions).
* Include comments when necessary to explain complex logic.

## Version Control

* Write conventional commit messages.

## Testing

* Follow the principles of a test-driven development.

## Continuous Learning

## Code Reviews

## Security

## Sustainability

## User-Centered Design

## Ethical Considerations
